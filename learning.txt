variabled are declared using var keyword, 
constants are declared using const keyword
go uses camelCase for naming convention

As go compiles errors, it enforces to use all declared variables and constants in code.
Go automatically adds spaces before and after variables name in print statements.

DataTypes:
    Go is statically typed language. it needs to tell go compiler about the datatype when we are declaring the variable.
    Type Inference: Go can infer type when you assign a value. 

    //No error
    var a = "xyz"
    const b = 2

    //error
    var a
    a="xyz"

    so to resolve this variable decalaration should be like this
    var a string
    a="xyz"

UserInput through Scanf
    Imagine:
        x = an empty box waiting for data

        &x = the address of that box

        fmt.Scan = a delivery person who needs your address to put something in

        If you don’t give the address (&x), they have no idea where to deliver your input.

Arrays:
    size to be fixed. need to declare with size
    syntax declaration: 
        var array_name [size]array_type
    adding elements using indexes
    eg : arr[0]= "abcd"

Slice :
    to handle array limitations. does not require size decalartion.
    Syntax: var slice_name []type
    adding elements using append function. it will add element at the last of the slice.
    eg : 
        booking = append(booking, "abcd")
