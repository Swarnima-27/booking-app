variabled are declared using var keyword, 
constants are declared using const keyword
go uses camelCase for naming convention

As go compiles errors, it enforces to use all declared variables and constants in code.
Go automatically adds spaces before and after variables name in print statements.

DataTypes:
    Go is statically typed language. it needs to tell go compiler about the datatype when we are declaring the variable.
    Type Inference: Go can infer type when you assign a value. 

    //No error
    var a = "xyz"
    const b = 2

    //error
    var a
    a="xyz"

    so to resolve this variable decalaration should be like this
    var a string
    a="xyz"
